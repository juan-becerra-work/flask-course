## Welcome to The Build a SAAS App with Flask Course!

*A video course where we build a real world web application with Flask, Celery,
Redis, PostgreSQL, Stripe and Docker.*

**Full details on the course can be found here:**  
[https://buildasaasappwithflask.com](https://buildasaasappwithflask.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=bsawf&utm_campaign=readme-top)

### Getting started

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```

### How does this source code differ than what's in the course?

In the course we build up a 4,000+ line Flask application in 15 stages while I'm
at your side explaining my thought process along the way.

You will get to see the source code grow from a single `app.py` file to a large
code base that spans across dozens of files and folders.

#### This repo includes up to the 6th stage. By this point in the code base, you'll be introduced to concepts such as:

- Using Docker to "Dockerize" a multi-service Flask app
- Using Flask extensions
- Flask blueprints
- Jinja templates
- Working with forms
- Sending e-mails through Celery
- Creating Click based CLI scripts
- Testing and analyzing your code base

#### The rest of the course covers topics such as:

- What is Docker and how can you use it?
- Going over the application's architecture and tech choices
- Creating a full blown user management system
- Creating a custom admin dashboard
- Logging, middleware and error handling
- Adding quality of life improvements to the CLI script
- Accepting recurring credit card payments with Stripe
- Building up a dice game called "Snake Eyes"
- Responding with JSON from Flask and creating AJAX requests
- Processing microtransaction payments with Stripe
- Dealing with database migrations
- Converting your app to support multiple languages (i18n)

**By the time you finish the course, you'll have all the confidence you need to
build a large web application with Flask**.

There's over 172 video lessons, 14+ hours of content, coding exercises and an
e-book that's included.

Also as a bonus, there's an additional 18 video lessons and 3 hours of content
that covers building a separate RESTful API driven application that uses web sockets.
